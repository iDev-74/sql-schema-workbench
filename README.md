## SQL Schema Workbench

**Offline intent. Online protection.**  
**This exists to remove the mundane and get you to meaningful work faster.**

---

## What This Is

A local, read-only SQL workbench designed for safe, everyday database exploration.

It helps you understand unfamiliar schemas, test queries without risk, and reason about data clearly — without modifying databases, relying on cloud services, or abstracting away SQL.

Everything runs locally. Your data stays on your machine.

---

## What This Is For

Use this tool when you need to:

- Understand the structure of an unfamiliar database
- Explore data safely without fear of writes
- Validate SQL logic before running it elsewhere
- Discover where values live across tables
- Build correct first-pass queries
- Reduce context switching during database work

It is designed for regular, real-world use — not demos.

---

## What This Is Not

This tool intentionally does **not**:

- Modify data or schemas
- Generate final answers or automated decisions
- Act as a BI or reporting platform
- Visualize schemas as ERDs
- Replace SQL with abstractions
- Use AI to guess intent

If you want automation or dashboards, there are better tools for that. This tool focuses on understanding.

## Core Principles

- **Read-only by design** — data-modifying queries are blocked
- **Schema-first** — understanding begins with structure
- **Offline-first** — no accounts, no telemetry, no cloud
- **Explicit limits** — constraints are intentional and explained
- **User in control** — the tool assists, it does not decide

The user is the painter. The tool is the brush.

## Supported Databases

- SQLite (local files)
- PostgreSQL
- MySQL
- SQL Server

---

## Getting Started

1. Launch the application
2. Connect to a database
3. Explore the schema
4. Test queries safely
5. Move on to the work that matters

For detailed workflows and feature explanations, see the [User Guide](USER_GUIDE.md).

## Safety and Privacy

- Runs entirely locally
- No telemetry or tracking
- No background network activity
- Credentials exist only in session memory

You can use this tool in secure, offline, or restricted environments.

---

## When Not to Use This Tool

This tool is not intended for:

- Production writes
- Automated pipelines
- Large-scale analytics
- Visualization-heavy exploration

It is designed to support thinking — not automation.

---

## Status

This project is considered **v1.0** when it reliably supports safe, everyday database exploration without expanding scope.

New features are added only when they reinforce clarity and reduce friction.
